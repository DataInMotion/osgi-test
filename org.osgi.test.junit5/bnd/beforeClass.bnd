# This bundle is used as part of the tests run under BundleContextExtensionTest.cleansUpBundlesMultiLevel() and
# cleansUpBundleInstallerMultiLevel(). Having many bundles allows us to install many at the same time and
# check that the correct ones are installed/uninstalled at the correct time as the test scope changes. As such,
# the actual contents of this bundle aren't important.
